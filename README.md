# [Adapt It Mobile](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile)

Adapt It Mobile is a **simple related language translation editor** designed specifically for mobile devices. Using a tablet or smartphone, you can use Adapt It Mobile to quickly translate text from one language to another related language. Previous translations are stored in a translation memory called a _Knowledge Base_, and are suggested the next time that particular word or phrase is encountered.

Adapt It Mobile is a ground-up rewrite of the [Adapt It desktop application](http://adapt-it.org/), written -- by the same developers -- specifically for mobile devices.

## Implementation Details

Adapt It Mobile is built using the cross-platform mobile framework [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/). We are currently developing versions for Android, iOS and Windows Phone 8.

## Getting Started

Adapt It Mobile is currently under development. Please check back at a later date for installation details.

## Contributing to the Project

For those wanting to contribute to this project, check out the [wiki pages](https://github.com/adapt-it/adapt-it-mobile/wiki). If you're a coder, tester, interface designer, or would like to localize Adapt It Mobile to your language, we'd love to talk!

## Philosophy

Adapt It Mobile is a free open source tool for quickly translating between related languages. We seek to create, as a community, an adaptation tool that will run on all major mobile platforms and facilitate translation of [USFM](http://paratext.ubs-translations.org/about/usfm) text, and support collaboration between other translation tools such as the desktop version of [Adapt It](http://adapt-it.org/) as well as [UBS Paratext](http://paratext.ubs-translations.org/) and [Bibledit](https://sites.google.com/site/bibledit/).
